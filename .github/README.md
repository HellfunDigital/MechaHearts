# MechaHearts - Digital TCG

MechaHearts is a digital collectible card game (TCG) featuring mecha pilots and their machines. Build your collection and battle against other players online.

## Features
- Build your collection of cards featuring unique mecha designs and pilots.

- Earn rewards and unlock new cards through gameplay.
- Customize your team with a variety of pilot's, equipment and upgrade cards.
- Regular updates and events to keep the game fresh.

## Pilot, Equipment and Upgrade cards

Pilot cards, Equipment, and Upgrade cards can only be used if there is a slot available on the mecha card. Each mecha card has a limited number of slots for Pilots, Equipment, and Upgrade. In this way, we can limit the number of powerful cards that a player can use in a game, making the game more balanced.

## Card Packs

The game also features a gatcha system, where players can use real money to purchase car packs. Each pack contains a random selection of cards from the available sets. This is an optional feature, and players can also earn cards through gameplay.

## Battle System
- Players start by selecting a team of 6 mech cards to use in battle.
- Each card represents a different mech and has its own set of values for attack, defense, speed, luck, and hp.
- Players can equip pilots, upgrades, and equipment to their mech cards before battle to increase their stats.
- The number of slots available for equipping pilots, upgrades, and equipment will vary between cards.
- Players take turns attacking each other, using their mech's attack value to deal damage to the opposing mech's hp.
- The opposing mech can defend using its defense value to reduce the damage taken.
- Speed and luck can also play a role in battle, with faster mechs having a higher chance to attack first, and luck determining the likelihood of critical hits or evading attacks.
- Players can switch out their active mech for one of the other five in their team during their turn
- The game ends when one player's team of mechs have all been defeated or when a set time limit is up.
